            <p>We wanted the act of getting married to be a very intimate, personal event. It’s important to us that we’re able to completely focus on each other during our ceremony, instead of getting wrapped up in the logistics and details of a wedding -- making sure everything goes as planned, that no one gets lost, that the music cues at just the right moment. The love and commitment can get lost somewhere in the midst.</p>

            <p>We’re both incredibly lucky to have friends and family that support and love us. We know that this marriage is about more than the two of us; it’s about the coming together of our two worlds and all the people we care about. But the ceremony, the vows, those will be just for us.</p>

            <p>We chose San Francisco because the City Hall is absolutely stunning! It’s the perfect place for us to sign our marriage license and smooch as husband and wife for the first time. (We’re hiring a photographer and we promise to share the photos!)</p>

            <p>After the ceremony, we’re hopping on the Amtrak and riding up to Portland. For fun. For romance. For Michael’s inexhaustible love of trains.</p>

            <p>After that, we’ll head back this way to celebrate with all of you!</p>

            <p>The wedding hooplah will kick-off at the Lodge at 4:00pm on Friday afternoon. This is a casual event, so wear whatever makes you feel fabulous. It should be a high of 83, low around 60. </p>

            <p>We will have dinner and treats. There will be dancing. There will be beverages. Maybe even board games.</p>

            <p>Around 7pm, we’ll move the party over to the group campsite area where we can build a fire and bust out the ukuleles. Please feel free to bring your own!</p>

          <p>We’ve reserved a block of rooms at the Aloft Hotel in Rogers. Unfortunately, there is a football game at UA in Fayetteville on Sep. 16th so all the hotels close to our venue are sold out. Aloft is about 45 minutes from the wedding venue.</p> 
            
          <p>We have also reserved a group camp area, for the campfire Friday night and as a space to hang out on Saturday/Sunday, and anyone who wants to take advantage of the space and camp is welcome to do so! The space is reserved Friday-Sunday, so feel free to hang out all weekend at beautiful Lake Wedington.</p>
